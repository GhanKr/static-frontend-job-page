# static-frontend-job-page

This is a simple static job listing site built using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT , FETCH API
User can see the jobs available in different companies and filter out according to the role 
It is currently static and data is hardcoded

Future plans
----------------------
Will try to make it a live website by fetching live jobs available from other job sites to display

Enjoy ...............
Thanks!
